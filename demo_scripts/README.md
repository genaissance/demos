# Demo Scripts  
Please put your demo scripts in this dir.

No these are not like code scripts, they are more like movie scripts, but for demos. 

In many cases, your demo may be fully self contained in one notebook and not need additional instructions. 

But, in some cases you need another set of instructions outside of your notebook. 
Maybe your demo has multiple notebooks, or maybe you have a demo in a notebook and you want to have seperate instructions for a presenter on how they should present it. Or whatever the case, if you need a demo script, please save it here.
